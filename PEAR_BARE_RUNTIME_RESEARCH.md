# Pear Runtime & Bare Runtime Research

## Overview
- **Pear Runtime**: Combined P2P Runtime, Development & Deployment tool
- **Bare Runtime**: Bare binary that bootstraps the platform
- **Organization**: Holepunch (formerly SSB/Scuttlebutt community)
- **Purpose**: Building decentralized, peer-to-peer applications

## Typical Use Cases
Based on GitHub repository descriptions:
- P2P chat applications
- File sharing systems
- Video streaming platforms
- Collaborative LLM tools
- Decentralized social networks
- Offline-first applications

## Current Project Analysis
**TomConvention.com** - Music/Event Convention Website
- **Tech Stack**: Vite, Tailwind CSS, Lucide icons, Netlify Identity, Pretix ticketing
- **Architecture**: Traditional web application with centralized deployment
- **Requirements**: SEO, authentication, payment processing, reliable hosting

## Assessment: Not Useful for This Project

### Why Not Suitable:
1. **Centralized Dependencies**: Project relies on Netlify Identity and Pretix - both require centralized services
2. **SEO Requirements**: Convention websites need search engine discoverability (P2P apps are often not indexed)
3. **Payment Processing**: Traditional ticketing/payment systems require centralized infrastructure
4. **User Expectations**: Attendees expect reliable, fast access to event information
5. **Deployment Model**: Current rsync deployment to traditional web server works well

### Where P2P Would Be Better:
- Decentralized social features for attendees
- Offline event scheduling/planning
- P2P file sharing for event materials
- Collaborative event organization tools

## Conclusion
Pear Runtime and Bare Runtime are excellent for decentralized applications but don't align with the needs of a traditional event/convention website. The current architecture with Vite, centralized auth, and traditional hosting is the appropriate choice.
