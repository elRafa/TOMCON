# Panel Schedule Implementation Summary - Chat Session

## Overview
This document summarizes the complete implementation of the panel schedule feature for TOM Convention 2025 website, including all fixes and deployments completed in this chat session.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Complete Panel Schedule Data Implementation ✅
- **Populated `schedule.js`** with full Friday and Saturday panel schedules
- **16 total panels** across both days with all panelists and moderators
- **6 panel hosts** now have working schedule buttons

### 2. Name Consistency Fixes ✅
Fixed multiple name mismatches between `schedule.js` and `guests.js`:

#### Names Corrected:
- **Matt Johnson** → **Matthew Johnson** (in schedule.js)
- **Chris Colbert** → **Christopher Colbert** (in schedule.js) 
- **Josh Lory** → **Joshua Lory** (in schedule.js)
- **Tim Mann** → **Timothy Mann** (in schedule.js)
- **Zak "Dutch" Schultz** → **Zak Schultz** (in schedule.js)
- **Edie Schmaltz Goodwin** → **Edie Goodwin** (in guests.js)

#### Image File Updates:
- Renamed `edie-schmaltz-goodwin.jpg/webp` → `edie-goodwin.jpg/webp`
- Renamed `zak-shultz.jpg/webp` → `zak-schultz.jpg/webp`

### 3. Panel Schedule Button Logic Fix ✅
- **Fixed button display logic** to only show "Show Panel Schedule" buttons in the Panel Hosts section
- **Prevented buttons** from appearing on hosts in other sections (performers, staff, etc.)
- **Added grid detection** in `renderGuests()` function

### 4. Responsive Styling Updates ✅
Updated `.panel-day-heading` positioning for day/time badges:
- **768px breakpoint**: `top: -1rem`
- **425px breakpoint**: `top: -0.8rem` 
- **375px breakpoint**: `top: -0.7rem`
- **320px breakpoint**: `top: -0.7rem`

### 5. Time Formatting Standardization ✅
- **Standardized time format** in `schedule.js` to use 12-hour format with am/pm
- **Removed end times** from panel data (e.g., "6:30-7:45pm" → "6:30pm")
- **Consistent formatting** across all panels
