# Deployment and Git Workflow Rules

## Build and Deploy Process
- **Always build before deploying**: `npm run build` then `./deploy.sh`
- **Verify dist/ contents** match expectations before deployment
- **Check asset paths** are correct for production environment
- **Deploy.sh targets**: Ensure `LOCAL_PATH="./dist"` not source directory

## Git Workflow Management
- **Handle rebase conflicts carefully** - don't force-push without understanding changes
- **Use descriptive commit messages** that explain both problem and solution
- **Pull before pushing** to avoid conflicts with remote changes
- **Check git status** before making assumptions about uncommitted changes

## File Management
- **Update .gitignore** to exclude system files (`.DS_Store`, `node_modules/`)
- **Include deployment files** ([deploy.sh](mdc:deploy.sh), [DEPLOYMENT.md](mdc:DEPLOYMENT.md)) in repository
- **Exclude build outputs** (`dist/`) from version control
- **Track package-lock.json** for dependency consistency

## Production Verification
- **Test on live site** after deployment to verify all assets load correctly
- **Check both main and legal pages** for consistent functionality
- **Verify WebP images** and other optimized assets are accessible
- **Confirm social media icons** and interactive elements work properly

## Rollback Strategy
- **Keep deployment backups** (deploy.sh creates these automatically)
- **Document deployment steps** for team members
- **Test locally** before deploying to catch issues early
