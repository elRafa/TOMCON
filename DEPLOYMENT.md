# TomCon Website Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to build, verify, and deploy the TomCon website to your web server.

## Quick Start

**Standard Deployment Workflow:**

```bash
npm run build    # Build with fresh cache
./deploy.sh      # Verify & deploy automatically
```

That's it! The deployment script automatically verifies the build before deploying.

---

## Setup (One-time configuration)

### 1. Configure Server Details

Edit the `deploy.sh` file and update these variables with your server information:

```bash
SERVER_HOST="your-server.com"           # Your server hostname or IP address
SERVER_USER="username"                  # Your SSH username
SERVER_PORT="22"                        # SSH port (usually 22)
REMOTE_PATH="/var/www/html"             # Remote directory path for website files
```

### 2. Add SSH Key to Server

If you haven't already, add your SSH public key to the server:

```bash
# Copy your public key
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

# Then add it to your server's authorized_keys file
# (This is usually done through your hosting control panel or by SSH'ing once with password)
```

### 3. Test SSH Connection

Before deploying, test your SSH connection:

```bash
ssh -p 22 username@your-server.com
```

## Build Process

### Building the Site

The build process includes automatic cache clearing and image optimization:

```bash
npm run build
```

**What happens during build:**
1. ‚úÖ Clears Vite cache (`.vite` directory)
2. ‚úÖ Clears previous build (`dist` directory)
3. ‚úÖ Optimizes images to WebP format
4. ‚úÖ Bundles JavaScript and CSS
5. ‚úÖ Compiles Tailwind CSS
6. ‚úÖ Copies static assets

**Important:** Always run a fresh build before deploying to ensure all changes are included.

---

## Build Verification

### Automatic Verification

Every deployment automatically verifies the build to prevent issues. The verification checks:

1. **Visible Guests** - All guests with `visibility: 1` are in the build
2. **Hidden Guests** - Guests with `visibility: 0` are correctly marked
3. **Critical Changes** - Recent important updates are included
4. **Build Freshness** - Warns if build is stale

### Manual Verification

You can verify a build independently:

```bash
npm run verify
```

**Success Output:**
```
‚úÖ All 66 visible guests found in build
‚úÖ All 3 hidden guests correctly marked
‚úÖ Deanna Moody correctly visible in build
‚úÖ Josh Kemble correctly hidden in build
‚úÖ Kevin Chen correctly visible in build
‚úÖ Build is fresh (45s old)

‚úÖ BUILD VERIFICATION PASSED!
Build is ready for deployment.
```

**Failure Output:**
```
‚ùå Missing 1 visible guests in build:
  - New Guest Name

‚ùå BUILD VERIFICATION FAILED!
Please fix the errors above before deploying.
```

### What Happens on Failure

If verification fails:
- ‚ùå Deployment **stops immediately**
- üìã Error message shows what's wrong
- üõ°Ô∏è Prevents bad builds from going live

**Common Fix:**
```bash
rm -rf dist .vite    # Clear caches
npm run build        # Rebuild fresh
npm run verify       # Check again
```

---

## Deployment

### Method 1: Command Line (Recommended)

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

The script will:
1. Check that `dist/` directory exists
2. **Automatically verify the build**
3. Stop if verification fails
4. Deploy if everything passes

### Method 2: Using Cursor/VS Code Tasks

1. Open Command Palette: `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux)
2. Type "Tasks: Run Task"
3. Select "Deploy to Server"
4. Watch the deployment progress in the terminal

### Method 3: Tell AI Assistant

Simply tell the AI: **"Deploy the website"** and it will run the deployment for you!

### What Gets Deployed

The deployment script will:

- ‚úÖ **Verify build** before deploying
- ‚úÖ Upload all website files (HTML, CSS, JS, images)
- ‚úÖ Create a backup of the current deployment
- ‚úÖ Set proper file permissions
- ‚úÖ Configure cache headers via `.htaccess`
- ‚úÖ Exclude unnecessary files (.git, .DS_Store, deploy.sh, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Show progress and status

## Troubleshooting

### Build Verification Fails

**Problem:** "Missing X visible guests in build" after updating `guests.js`

**Cause:** Vite's build cache didn't pick up the changes

**Solution:**
```bash
rm -rf dist .vite    # Clear both dist and Vite cache
npm run build        # Rebuild fresh
npm run verify       # Verify again
./deploy.sh          # Deploy
```

### Stale Build Warning

**Problem:** "Build is X minutes old - consider rebuilding"

**Solution:** 
```bash
npm run build        # Create fresh build
```

### Guest Visibility Issues

**Problem:** Changes to `guests.js` not appearing on live site

**Check:**
1. Is the guest's `visibility` set correctly in source?
2. Did you run `npm run build` after making changes?
3. Did verification pass?
4. Clear browser cache and hard refresh

**Solution:**
```bash
npm run build        # Always rebuild after data changes
./deploy.sh          # Verification will catch any issues
```

### SSH Connection Issues

If you get SSH connection errors:

1. **Check server details** in `deploy.sh`
2. **Verify SSH key** is added to server
3. **Test manual SSH**: `ssh username@your-server.com`
4. **Check firewall** settings on server
5. **Verify SSH port** (default is 22)

### Permission Issues

If you get permission denied errors:

1. Make sure your SSH user has write access to the remote directory
2. You might need to use `sudo` or a different user
3. Contact your hosting provider for proper permissions

### File Not Found Errors

If specific files aren't deploying:

1. Check they're not in the exclude list
2. Verify file names don't have special characters
3. Ensure files exist locally before deployment

---

## Advanced Usage

### Updating Critical Verification Checks

When making important changes to guest data, update the critical checks in `verify-build.js`:

```javascript
const criticalGuests = [
    { name: 'Deanna Moody', shouldBeVisible: true },
    { name: 'Josh Kemble', shouldBeVisible: false },
    { name: 'Kevin Chen', shouldBeVisible: true },
    // Add new critical guests here
    { name: 'New Important Guest', shouldBeVisible: true }
];
```

### Files Excluded from Deployment

The following files/patterns are automatically excluded:

- `deploy.sh`, `verify-build.js` (build scripts)
- `.git/` (Git repository)
- `.gitignore`
- `README.md`, `*.md` (documentation)
- `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db` (system files)
- `node_modules/` (if using Node.js)
- `.env*` (environment files)
- `.vite/` (build cache)

---

## Security & Best Practices

**Security:**
- ‚úÖ Uses SSH key authentication (more secure than passwords)
- ‚úÖ Creates backups before deployment
- ‚úÖ Excludes sensitive files automatically
- ‚úÖ Uses rsync for efficient transfers

**Best Practices:**
- ‚úÖ Always build before deploying
- ‚úÖ Let verification run automatically
- ‚úÖ Test on localhost first
- ‚úÖ Check live site after deployment

---

## Post-Deployment

After successful deployment:

1. **Verify deployment succeeded** - Check the deployment output
2. **Test the live website** at https://tomconvention.com
3. **Check all pages** work correctly
4. **Verify images** and assets load properly
5. **Test interactive features** (keyboard navigation, card flipping, B-key overlay)
6. **Clear browser cache** if needed to see latest changes

If something breaks, you can restore from the automatic backup created during deployment.
