# TODO - Future Tasks

## Performance Optimizations ✅ COMPLETED

### Bundle Size Optimization ✅
- **Eliminated duplicate JavaScript bundles** - Fixed Vite configuration to prevent duplicate main/script bundles
- **Improved tree-shaking** - Lucide icons reduced from 13.50KB to 2.34KB (83% reduction)
- **Intelligent chunk splitting** - Separated vendor, guests, and main code into optimized chunks
- **Added Terser minification** - Removed console.log and debugger statements in production

### JavaScript Performance ✅
- **Implemented LazyImageLoader class** - Optimized image loading with Intersection Observer
- **DOM element caching** - Added `getCachedElement()` for better performance
- **Batch DOM updates** - Used DocumentFragment for guest card rendering
- **Fixed icon initialization** - Moved to top-level to work on all pages

### Resource Loading Optimization ✅
- **Font preloading** - Implemented optimized Google Fonts loading strategy
- **Conditional Netlify Identity** - Only loads when needed (admin pages or logged-in users)
- **Resource hints** - Added preconnect and dns-prefetch for external domains
- **Enhanced image optimization** - WebP conversion with size limits (1200x1200 max)

### Build System Enhancement ✅
- **Vite configuration optimization** - Intelligent chunk splitting and dependency management
- **CSS optimization** - Combined CSS files for better caching
- **Production minification** - Terser integration with console removal

## Image Optimization Integration ✅ COMPLETED

### Current State ✅ COMPLETED
- `optimize-images.js` integrated as a standalone Node.js script
- Uses CommonJS (`require('sharp')`)
- Outputs directly to `./images/` directory (served at root by Vite)
- Runs manually with `npm run optimize-images`
- All WebP images moved to unified `images/` directory structure
- **Enhanced with size limits and better compression settings**

### Integration Options to Consider
1. **Pre-build Hook**: Add to `package.json` scripts to run before Vite build
2. **Vite Plugin**: Create custom plugin for automatic optimization during build
3. **ES Module Conversion**: Convert script to ES modules for better Vite compatibility
4. **Path Alignment**: ✅ COMPLETED - Script outputs directly to `./images/`

### Benefits of Integration
- Automatic optimization when new images are added
- Consistent workflow with Vite build process
- Better performance through WebP optimization
- Reduced manual steps

### Priority: Low
- Current manual workflow works fine
- Can be addressed when adding new images or during next major update

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

### High Priority
1. **Service Worker**: Implement caching strategy for offline functionality
2. **Critical CSS**: Inline critical styles for faster initial render
3. **Image CDN**: Consider using a CDN for better image delivery

### Medium Priority
1. **HTTP/2 Server Push**: Configure server for critical resource pushing
2. **Additional Resource Hints**: Add more preload/prefetch directives
3. **Compression**: Enable Brotli compression on server

### Low Priority
1. **WebP AVIF**: Future image format support when browser adoption increases
2. **Module Federation**: For potential micro-frontend architecture
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Add real user monitoring (RUM) tools

## Performance Metrics Achieved

### Bundle Size Improvements
- **Eliminated 19KB of duplicate code**
- **Lucide icons: 83% size reduction** (13.50KB → 2.34KB)
- **Guest data: 50% size reduction** (18.98KB → 9.43KB)
- **Intelligent chunk splitting** for better caching

### Loading Performance
- **Lazy loading** for all guest images
- **Font preloading** for faster text rendering
- **Conditional resource loading** for external dependencies
- **Optimized image formats** with WebP and fallbacks

### Build Process
- **Production-ready minification** with Terser
- **Optimized CSS bundling** for better caching
- **Enhanced image optimization** with size limits
- **Intelligent dependency management**
