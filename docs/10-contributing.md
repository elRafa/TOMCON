## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### JavaScript

```javascript
// Use modern ES6+ features
const guestData = {
    name: "Guest Name",
    projects: "Band Name, Other Projects",
    visibility: 1
};

// Use descriptive variable names
const currentFlippedCard = null;
const isKeyboardNavigationEnabled = false;

// Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
function renderGuestCard(guest) {
    const cardElement = document.createElement('div');
    cardElement.className = 'guest-card';
    return cardElement;
}

// Use JSDoc comments for functions
/**
 * Renders the back face of a guest card with question form
 * @param {string} guestName - The name of the guest
 * @param {boolean} useFullName - Whether to use full name or first name
 * @returns {string} HTML string for the card back
 */
function renderCardBack(guestName, useFullName = false) {
    // Implementation
}
```

### CSS

```css
/* Use consistent naming conventions */
.guest-card {
    /* Use CSS custom properties for colors */
    background-color: var(--color-background);
    color: var(--color-text);
    
    /* Use consistent spacing */
    padding: 1rem;
    margin-bottom: 1rem;
    
    /* Use consistent transitions */
    transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out;
}

/* Use BEM methodology for complex components */
.card-container__flipper {
    /* Component element */
}

.card-container--flipped {
    /* Component modifier */
}

/* Use mobile-first responsive design */
@media (min-width: 640px) {
    .guest-card {
        width: calc(50% - 0.5rem);
    }
}
```

### HTML

```html
<!-- Use semantic HTML elements -->
<main id="main-content" role="main">
    <section aria-labelledby="event-details">
        <h2 id="event-details">Event Details</h2>
        <article>
            <h3>Event Information</h3>
            <p>Event description...</p>
        </article>
    </section>
</main>

<!-- Use proper accessibility attributes -->
<button 
    type="button" 
    aria-label="Close card"
    class="close-btn">
    &times;
</button>

<!-- Use proper form labels -->
<label for="question-input">Your Question</label>
<textarea 
    id="question-input"
    name="question"
    maxlength="140"
    required
    aria-describedby="question-help">
</textarea>
<div id="question-help">Maximum 140 characters</div>
```
